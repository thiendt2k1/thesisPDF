Firstly, I would like to thank my teaching advisor, Mr Thinh, for his invaluable advice and guidance on this article. Without his support and instructions, i couldn't have completed this paper on time and sufficient enough, he has been been very generous and patiently guide me through challenges despite my stubborn and lack of communication skill.

Secondly, I also want to extend my thanks to my family and friends, especially Phong, who have always supported and encouraged me throughout this journey. They have been a constant source of inspiration, motivation and strength, and I am grateful for their presence in my life.

Additionally, I want to thank my reviewers, who have listened, and given me some hard, cold facts, and point out my logic flaws and mistakes in this paper through their entire gasp of knowledge. Thanks to your support, I have been able to fill some hole in my perspective, and improve the quality of my work.

Lastly, I express my gratitude to all the authors, readers, and reviewers, as your input and evaluation have been crucial to me. They have helped me identify the shortcomings in my writing and provided insights into the direction of my research. Thank you all!

Once again, I want to send my thanks and appreciation to all those who have supported and encouraged me.
